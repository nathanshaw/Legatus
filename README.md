# Legatus Hardware

This repo contains the PCB layout and schematic files for the Legatus genus.
Legatus is one of three genera developed for the Acropolis family of soundscape augmentation artefacts. Legatus specialises in loudspeaker-based cochlear soundscape augmentation.

The files were created within EAGLE CAD

The Legatus genus firmware is contained in this repo: https://github.com/nathanshaw/unified_hss_firmware
